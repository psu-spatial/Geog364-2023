The aim of this lab is to get comfortable in R and in R-Markdown. Lab
instructions will be here, linking to relevant tutorials in the
tutorials tab. The Canvas page for this lab is here
<https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2260204/assignments/15455191>

<br>

**If the labs are causing major problems with your computer or your
computer hardware is struggling (or you have any other software issue),
Talk to Dr Greatrex**.

**What do I mean by struggling? More than 20 minutes without any
progress..**

<br>

#### MY MAIN HINT

Please follow ALL THE STEPS.

I *literally* give the answers to the final section in these tutorials
and it will only take an experienced R user a few minutes. IT IS FASTER
THAN SKIPPING TO THE END!

<br> <br>

## A. Choosing a lab partner.

#### We will be doing an in-class exercise to choose lab groups

TUESDAY LAB: Please fill in this survey:
<https://forms.gle/Uf7T5Hh7895Y7G6DA>

(Don't touch wed/fri lab)

We will do an in-class exercise to self select smaller groups for Labs.
After the exercuse, Introduce yourselves and name your team!

<br> <br>

## B. Review the Lab Q&A

First, please review the lab Q&A: [**CLICK
HERE**](in_G364_Lab0_FAQ.rmd). It explains

-   What you need to submit
-   How you are graded and where the rubric is
-   The late policy
-   What counts as cheating
-   You're going to be asked about this below, so may as well read it.

Follow [TUTORIAL
1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial01WhatisR.html)
to learn about R, R-studio and Markdown. You're going to be asked about
this below, so you may as well read it now.

## E. Lab set-up (Tutorial 3)

As discussed in

### Paragraph questions 

### Paragraph questions 

You might find it easier to use the markdown visual text editor. Here's
the difference between writing your reports in 'source' mode (near the
top left) vs 'visual' mode.

![](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-source-visual.png)

**OK - now you should have an empty report, other than the 'YAML' code
at the top.**

**Copy each of the questions below into your report. Make each one
"heading 3" format.**

**Underneath each question in a new paragraph ("Normal" format), answer
it! At least 3 or 4 sentences for each one.** <br><br>

[**QUESTION 1:**]{.underline} In your own words, explain the course late
policy (hint, see [Lab
FAQs](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_G364_Lab0_FAQ.html))
<br>

[**QUESTION 2:**]{.underline} When are Dr G's office hours? (hint, see
[Canvas](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2260204))<br>

[**QUESTION 3:**]{.underline} Can you copy/paste each others report code
or text? (Hint, [Lab
FAQs](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_G364_Lab0_FAQ.html))
<br>

[**QUESTION 4:**]{.underline} Use something like spotify (a programme
that plays music) to explain the difference between R and R-Studio.
(hint, [TUTORIAL
1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial01WhatisR.html))
<br\>

[**QUESTION 5:**]{.underline} Explain the range of different formats a
markdown document can be made into <br> (hint, [TUTORIAL
1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial01WhatisR.html))

## H. Submitting your Lab

Remember to save your work throughout and to spell check your writing
(next to the save button). Now, press the knit button again. If you have
not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a html file in
your lab 1 folder which includes your answers. If you look at your lab 1
folder, you should see this there - complete with a very recent
time-stamp.

In that folder, double click on the html file. This will open it in your
web-browser.\
CHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT.

If you are on R studio cloud, see Tutorial 1 for how to download your
files

Now go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file in Lab 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/LabFig_WhatToSubmit.png")
```

<br>

## 7. How am I graded?

Look on Canvas, there will be a SPECIFIC RUBRIC that we use to grade
your lab. USE IT!!! It should allow you to predict your grade. We will
also include comments with our feedback in every lab.

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rubric <- readxl::read_excel("in_G364_Lab0Rubric.xlsx")
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))


```
