<br>

The aim of this lab is to get comfortable in R and in R-Markdown. Lab
instructions will be here, linking to relevant tutorials in the
tutorials tab. The Canvas page for this lab is here
<https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2260204/assignments/15455191>

<br>

**If the labs are causing major problems with your computer or your
computer hardware is struggling (or you have any other software issue),
Talk to Dr Greatrex**.

**What do I mean by struggling? More than 20 minutes without any
progress..**

<br>

#### MY MAIN HINT

Please follow ALL THE STEPS.

I *literally* give the answers to the final section in these tutorials
and it will only take an experienced R user a few minutes. IT IS FASTER
THAN SKIPPING TO THE END!

<br> <br>

## 1. Choosing a lab partner. 

#### We will be doing an in-class exercise to choose lab groups

TUESDAY LAB: Please fill in this survey:
<https://forms.gle/Uf7T5Hh7895Y7G6DA>

(Don't touch wed/fri lab)

We will do an in-class exercise to self select smaller groups for Labs.
You will choose your lab partner from these.

<br> <br>

## 2. Review the Lab Q&A

First, please review the lab Q&A: [**CLICK
HERE**](in_G364_Lab0_FAQ.rmd). It explains

-   What you need to submit
-   How you are graded and where the rubric is
-   The late policy
-   What counts as cheating
-   You're going to be asked about this below, so may as well read it.

<br> <br>

## 2. Follow Tutorial 1, what are R, R-studio and Markdown?

Review [TUTORIAL 1](in_Tutorial1WhatisR.rmd "Tutorial 1")to learn about
R, R-studio and Markdown

You're going to be asked about this below, so may as well read it.

<br> <br>

## 3. Initial Lab set-up {.unnumbered}

Review [TUTORIAL 2](in_Tutorial02SetUp.rmd "Tutorial 2")to learn about
R, R-studio and Markdown

Create a new **RMarkdown document** called `STAT462-Lab1-PSUID.Rmd`.
e.g. for me *STAT462-Lab1-hlg5155.Rmd*. <br>

Delete any friendly welcome text so you have a blank space.

<br>

### 2a: Adding paragraphs & course late policy {.unnumbered}

You might find it easier to use the markdown visual text editor. <br>
[Click the "Visual" symbol at the top left of the document to
switch.](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/images/rstudio-source-visual.png)

-   In the white text area, create a level 1 Header called
    *"Introduction to STAT-462"*.

-   Leave a blank line, then use the STAT-462 syllabus to describe the
    course late policy in your own words (e.g. you're writing about this
    in the white space).

-   Press "knit" at the top of the screen. If you haven't made a mistake
    a pop up should appear with a html file and your edits. If you have
    a made a mistake, stop and fix before continuing or talk to a
    teacher.

<br>

## 3: Code showcase

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/Lab1_Basics_CodeChunk.png")
```

\<br\<

Leave another blank line and add a new Level 1 Header called *"Code
Showcase"*. Add a blank line afterwards too - the reason for all the
blank lines is that R formatting often gets messed up with not enough
blank lines, but it will ignore excess ones.

Create a code chunk. Inside **use R code** to calculate the following.
You HAVE to show the code! <br><br>

-   103^3^ (e.g `103*103*103`, or `103^3`) <br>

\_ The co-sine of your age (google is your friend, google R function for
cosine) <br>

-   Use R code to work out how many characters are in [the longest town
    name in
    Wales](https://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/09/how-to-pronounce-the-longest-place-name-in-the-u-k)
    *Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch*. <br>\
    -   Hint 1, remember you can copy paste this into your code. <br>
    -   Hint 2.. your tutorials and quote marks!<br>
    -   Hint 3.. you can google any R command, try googling the *"R
        command for number of characters in a word"*.<br><br>

Press "knit" at the top of the screen. If you haven't made a mistake a
pop up should appear with a html file and your edits. If you have a made
a mistake, stop and fix before continuing.

<br>

## 4. Packages

Today we will be using commands from several packages. Somewhere near
the top of your script, make a new code chunk and add this code. We will
probably have to install them first (see the tutorial)

Remember to run the code chunk! [(pressing the green arrow, or go to the
run button on the top right and press Run
All](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/posts/2020-09-07-introducing-the-rstudio-ide-and-r-markdown/gifs/run-chunk.gif))

```{r,warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(ggpubr)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

<br>

## 6. Submitting your Lab

Remember to save your work throughout and to spell check your writing
(next to the save button). Now, press the knit button again. If you have
not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a html file in
your lab 1 folder which includes your answers. If you look at your lab 1
folder, you should see this there - complete with a very recent
time-stamp.

In that folder, double click on the html file. This will open it in your
web-browser.\
CHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT.

If you are on R studio cloud, see Tutorial 1 for how to download your
files

Now go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file in Lab 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/LabFig_WhatToSubmit.png")
```

<br>

## 7. How am I graded?

Look on Canvas, there will be a SPECIFIC RUBRIC that we use to grade
your lab. USE IT!!! It should allow you to predict your grade. We will
also include comments with our feedback in every lab.

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rubric <- readxl::read_excel("in_G364_Lab0Rubric.xlsx")
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))


```
