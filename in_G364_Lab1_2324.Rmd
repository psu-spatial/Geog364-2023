The aim of Lab 1 is to get comfortable in R and in R-Markdown and to
make sure that both are installed properly. It is a "one week lab" and
you can find the Canvas page here:
<https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2260204/assignments/15455191>

Instructions are below, linking to relevant tutorials in the tutorials
tab. If I suggest using a tutorial, the answers WILL be there.

Finally, if the labs are causing major problems or you have any other
software issue, talk to Dr Greatrex or Harman. What do I mean by
struggling? More than 15-20 minutes without progress.

# Lab instructions

## A. Select Lab Groups

We will be doing an in-class exercise to choose lab groups

-   TUESDAY LAB: Please fill in this survey:
    <https://forms.gle/Uf7T5Hh7895Y7G6DA> \
    (Don't touch wed/fri lab)

<br>

## B. Review FAQ

Review [The LAB FAQ](in_G364_Lab0_FAQ.rmd) - you can find it in the Labs
menu at the top of the page. It explains

-   What you need to submit
-   How you are graded and where the rubric is
-   The late policy
-   What counts as cheating

<br>

## C. Learn about R, R-studio and Markdown

Follow [TUTORIAL
1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial01WhatisR.html)
to learn about R, R-studio and Markdown.

<br>

## D. Initial Semester set-up

Follow [TUTORIAL
2](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial02SetUp.html)
to install everything needed for the GEOG-364 this semester.

<br>

## E. Lab 1 set-up

I strongly suggest you CLOSELY follow [TUTORIAL
3](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial02SetUp.html)
to install everything needed for lab 1. This means you will: <br>

-   Create a GEOG364 folder somewhere easy on your computer

-   Create a project for lab 1, saving it within that GEOG364 folder.

-   Change your global settings as requested in the tutorial.

-   Use the instructions to download/install a package called
    `rmdformats`

-   Create a markdown file using a template of your choice.

-   Save as GEOG364_Lab1_USERID.Rmd e.g. for me,
    GEOG364_Lab1_hlg5155.Rmd

-   Press knit to check it works (you may get a message asking you to
    install more packages)

-   Finally, remove all the 'friendly welcome text' below the YAML code,
    change the title to Lab 1 and press knit .<br>

You should now have a blank file in front of you, other than the YAML
code. If not, ask for help.

<br>

## F. Comprehension questions

1.  Write the word *Introduction* in the main body of the text - make it
    a Header 1 format. Leave a few blank lines above and below it. Press
    knit, check it worked.

2.  Now copy each of the questions below into your report. Make each one
    "Header 3" format.

3.  Underneath each question write your answer. At least 3 or 4
    sentences for each one. <br>

    1.  QUESTION 1: <br>In your own words, explain the course late
        policy<br> *Hint, [Lab
        FAQs](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_G364_Lab0_FAQ.html))*
        <br>

    2.  QUESTION 2: <br>When are Dr G's office hours? Should I email or
        Canvas Message to get help fast? *Hint, see
        [Canvas](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2260204)* <br>

    3.  QUESTION 3: <br>Are you allowed to copy/paste anyone else's code
        or text in your submission? Explain your answer. *Hint, [Lab
        FAQs](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_G364_Lab0_FAQ.html))*
        <br>

    4.  QUESTION 4: <br>Use something like Spotify (a computer programme
        that plays custom playlists of music) to explain the difference
        between R and R-Studio. *Hint, [Tutorial
        1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial01WhatisR.html))*
        <br>

    5.  QUESTION 5: <br>Explain the range of different formats a
        markdown document can be made into. *Hint, [Tutorial
        1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial01WhatisR.html))*<br>

To help with formatting, you might find it easier to use the markdown
visual text editor. Here's the difference between writing your reports
in 'source' mode (near the top left) vs 'visual' mode.

## F. Code showcase

Now, leave another new blank line and add a new Level 1 Header called
*"Code Showcase"*. Add a blank line afterwards too - the reason for all
the blank lines is that R formatting often gets messed up with not
enough blank lines, but it will ignore excess ones.

Create a separate code chunk for each problem below. Inside **use R
code** to calculate the answers. You HAVE to show the code! <br><br>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/LabFig1_CodeChunk.png")
```

IF YOU DON'T IMMEDIATELY KNOW HOW TO DO THESE, FOLLOW [Tutorial
4](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial04ConsoleBasics.html)

1.  103^3^ (e.g `103*103*103`, or `103^3`) <br>\
2.  The co-sine of your age (google is your friend, google R function or
    example for cosine) <br>\
3.  How many characters are in [the longest town name in
    Wales](https://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/09/how-to-pronounce-the-longest-place-name-in-the-u-k)
    *Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch*. <br>\
    -   Hint 1, remember you can copy paste this name into your code.
        <br>
    -   Hint 2, the command is available in the tutorials..
    -   Hint 3, you can google any R command, try googling the *"R
        command for number of characters in a word"*.<br><br>

Press "knit" at the top of the screen . If you have a made a mistake and
it doesn't knit, stop and fix before continuing.

<br>

## H. Submitting your Lab

Remember to save your work throughout and to spell check! (next to the
save button). Now, press the knit button one final time.

On R-Desktop

-   If you have not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a
    html file in your lab 1 folder which includes your answers.

-   If you look at your lab 1 folder on your computer, you should see
    this there - complete with a very recent time-stamp. Double click on
    the html file. This will open it in your web-browser.\
    CHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT.<br>

On Rstudio cloud,

-   See [TUTORIAL
    3](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial02SetUp.html)
    for how to download your files <br>

Finally, go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file in
Lab 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/LabFig_WhatToSubmit.png")
```

<br>

### How am I graded?

Look on Canvas, there will be a SPECIFIC RUBRIC that we use to grade
your lab. USE IT!!! It should allow you to predict your grade. We will
also include comments with our feedback in every lab.

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rubric <- readxl::read_excel("in_G364_Lab0Rubric.xlsx")
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))


```
