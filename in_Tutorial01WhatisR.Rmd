# R is a LANGUAGE

**R** is a free, open source statistical programming language. It contains millions of words/commands that are useful for dataset cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

By a "programming language", I mean it is a collection of commands that you can type into the computer in order to analyse and visualise data.  The easiest way I find to think about R is that it is literally a language, like Spanish, English or Hindi.  Or like a set of magic commands in a fantasy novel.

Learning R means learning vocabulary and grammar in order to communicate. It also means it gets easier with experience and practice..

<br>

If you open "R" on your computer (DON'T DO THIS), you will see a simple window with a cursor ready to hear commands. There is no help or support. This is how I learned to programme in R. It's not fun!

```{r, Tut_Fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "*Basic R*",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/fig1_RConsole.png')
```

# R-STUDIO/POSIT is a Software App 

**R-studio** is a *software program/app*, like Microsoft Word, or the Chrome Web-browser. It's has recently been rebranded to Posit. There is a version you can download onto your own computer, and a version that runs on a website called 'R-Studio Cloud'.

<https://posit.co/blog/announcing-rstudio-1-4/>

It's a program that's designed to make it easy to write R-commands. RStudio has many useful features. For example, you can easily see help files, run code, see your results and create outputs like this lab book! R-Studio also allows us to make interactive documents called R-Markdown files.

<br>

```{r, Tut_Fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "*R-studio is much more sophisticated*",fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./Figures/fig2_RStudioIntro.png')
```
