Welcome to Lab 3B on Point Pattern Analysis. A point pattern dataset is
comprised of events or objects occurring in a defined study region.
These events could represent anything with a specific measurable point
location.

**Objective:** The goal of Lab 3B is to learn some introductory spatial
statistical approaches for characterizing the spatial properties of a
point pattern.

-   **This week:** We will be focusing on point pattern DISTANCE
    analysis e.g. nearest neighbour

-   You need to submit everything on this page AND lab 3A under Lab 3 on
    canvas

    See the rubric on canvas (this is up!) for how it will be graded and
    the checklist at the end for what you need for 100%.

See [The Canvas page
here](https://psu.instructure.com/courses/2260204/assignments/15455241),
or go to canvas for assignment guidelines. You can use either the
website base RStudio/Posit Cloud OR R-Desktop for this lab.

Getting stuck? Look at the Canvas page for the McGrew Chapter 14 - it
has a great overview.

<br><br><br>

# Getting started

## 1. CONTINUE FROM LAB 3A!

Go back and check that you are happy with Lab 3A. Quickly reread your
work and make sure that it all make sense and knits neatly.

We will be continuing Lab 3B IN THE SAME DOCUMENT (e.g. you are
submitting one single Lab 3 to canvas which includes both 3A and 3B).

<br><br><br>

## 2. Install new packages

<br><br><br>

## 4. EDIT your library code chunk

It is good form to keep all your "library commands" at the top of your
script. Scroll up to your library code chunk and add in these additional
packages. You might need to install these packages first. If so, the
easiest way is to add the library command to the code chunk, press
knit/save and a little yellow banner will pop up asking if you want to
install them.

If it doesn't follow the instructions in Lab 3A and Tutorial 3 for
installing packages.

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#Content to add
```

Now click the Knit Button and make sure everything looks correct.

<br><br><br>

Content to be uploaded.

<br><br><br>

# Submitting your work

Remember to save your work throughout and to spell check! (next to the
save button). Now, press the knit button one final time.

On R-Desktop

-   If you have not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a
    html file in your lab 3 folder which includes your answers.

-   If you look at your lab 3 folder on your computer, you should see
    the html there - complete with a very recent time-stamp. Double
    click on the html file. This will open it in your web-browser.\
    CHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT.<br>

On Rstudio cloud,

-   See [TUTORIAL 3 Cloud - LINK
    FIXED](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial03LabSetUp.html#Projects_using_Rstudioposit_Cloud)
    for how to download your files <br>

Finally, go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file in
Lab 3.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/LabFig_WhatToSubmit.png")
```

<br><br>

## How am I graded?

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rubric <- readxl::read_excel("in_G364_Lab0Rubric.xlsx")
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))


```
