# 1. **Welcome to Lab 5**

The objective of this lab is to introduce you to the concept of Moran's
I and LISA.

**This is due by 23:59pm Sunday 10th December.**

See the rubric on canvas for how it will be graded and the checklist at
the end for what you need for 100%. <br>

<br><br>

```{r,include=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# invisible data read
library(tidyverse)
library(sp)
library(sf)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
library(tmap)
library(viridis)
library(kableExtra)
library(spatstat)
library(spatstat.data)
library(car)
```

# 2. Important (please read!)

<br>

We are continuing to focus on air pollution in California and build on
Lab 4.

**You can read about the data and remind yourself of things like column
names from the description of Lab 4.**

But! Due to the challenges facing those using R studio cloud, I have
created spatial data files of all the processed data from lab 4 and I
have included much of the code for lab 5.

**THIS MEANS WE WILL BE CREATING A COMPLETELY NEW LAB PROJECT AS THOUGH
IT WAS A NEW TOPIC (See below for instructions).**

<br><br>

# 3. Getting started.

## A. Create your project

In Desktop R, select your 364 directory, create a new project, then name
the project Lab 5. If you are stuck on this process, see these tutorials

-   For R-Desktop, see [Tutorial
    3B](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial03LabSetUp.html#Projects_using_Desktop)

-   For Posit Cloud, see [Tutorial
    3C](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial03LabSetUp.html#Projects_using_Rstudioposit_Cloud)
    <br>

You can check this has worked by looking on the file explorer on your
computer, then selecting your GEOG364 folder and checking that a Lab 5
folder has appeared with your `.Proj` file inside it. This is what you
double click to access this lab in R.

<br><br>

# 4. Get the lab report template and data

Go to CANVAS LAB 5, download the lab report template and all the data
sets. If you are on the cloud, ignore the census tract dataset. Rename
the lab report (the .RmD file) to include your email ID and place
EVERYTHING in your Lab 5 folder.

Now open your project and your lab report template (the .RmD file).

<br>

# 5. Complete the lab report

<br>

I have included all of these instructions in the lab report itself, but
it will make life easier to read them first here so you know what you
are doing.

<br>

## A. Read in the data

Get Section A of your lab script running and make sure it has read in
the data without error. Talk to a teacher if you have any issues (and
make sure the data is in the same folder as your .proj file and not
accidentally in a sub-folder or a different place)

<br>

## B. Voronoi polygons

In Section B of your report, I have provided some code which summarizes
and maps the ozone data by counties and voronoi polygons. You should be
able to just run the code and it will make the plots

In your report, below the code: <br>

-   Describe what each map is showing and what voronoi polygons are.
    <br>

-   Compare and contrast the three maps. <br>

-   For each map, explain the advantages and disadvantages of using this
    way to summarize & visualize the ozone data.<br>

<br><br>

## C. Moran's I tutorial

There is an excellent tutorial on Moran's I created by Dr Manny Gimond
here on incomes in Maine. We will also be working through this in class.

<https://mgimond.github.io/simple_moransI_example/>

In Section C ('Maine Tutorial') of your lab report, I want you to work
through the tutorial. (You do not have to do the Florida homicides bit).
<br>

-   I want the code working in your lab report, <br>
-   I also want as many comments as you can following along in the text,
    e.g. make yourself a tutorial IN YOUR OWN WORDS <br>

<br> <br>

## D. Moran's I of the California data

In Section D of your lab report, I provided a shortened version of the
code in Dr Gimond's tutorial. My code is set to look at the ozone
levels. Get it running, then in your report under my code, interpret
what I found in your own words.

<br>

Then, copy and edit my code to conduct a Moran's I analysis of a
variable (column) of your choice and interpret your findings in the
text.

<br><br>

## E. LISA analysis

Finally, my code for the LISA analysis should just run. Using the
lecture notes and readings interpret what the maps are showing you. Your
write up should include

-   What do each of the four colors/quadrants mean <br>
-   How do they link to the Moran scatterplot <br>
-   Change the critical value to 0.01, and to 0.1 and to 0.5 - and each
    time, re-run the LISA code (everything below the critical value).
    Explain what is happening in terms of ozone pollution in California.
    <br>

<br><br>

# 6. Submitting your work

Remember to save your work throughout and to spell check! (next to the
save button). Now, press the knit button one final time.

On R-Desktop

-   If you have not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a
    html file in your lab 5 folder which includes your answers.

-   If you look at your lab 5 folder on your computer, you should see
    the html there - complete with a very recent time-stamp. Double
    click on the html file. This will open it in your web-browser.\
    CHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT.<br>

On Rstudio cloud,

-   See [TUTORIAL 3 Cloud - LINK
    FIXED](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2023/in_Tutorial03LabSetUp.html#Projects_using_Rstudioposit_Cloud)
    for how to download your files <br>

Finally, go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file in
Lab 3.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/LabFig_WhatToSubmit.png")
```

<br><br>

## How am I graded?

Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rubric <- readxl::read_excel("in_G364_Lab0Rubric.xlsx")
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))


```
